<p>North Korea has claimed its latest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Hwasong-19, as “the world’s strongest" missile.The test, conducted on Thursday, saw the missile fly higher and longer than any previously launched by the nation, as reported by the Associated Press. Foreign analysts assert that North Korea still faces major technological challenges before it can effectively target the mainland United States.
    The North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that supreme leader Kim Jong Un supervised the launch, framing it as a demonstration of North Korea’s commitment to counter external threats. The launch's images suggested the missile employs preloaded solid fuel, making it more agile and less detectable compared to traditional liquid fuels.</p>
